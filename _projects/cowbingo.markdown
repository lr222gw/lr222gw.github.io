## Brief About Cowbingo

Cowbingo is my brainchild. While the concept of letting animals determine the next number is not entirely novel, the incorporation of a power-up system adds a unique and enjoyable twist. It's a local multiplayer game where the objective is to achieve bingo before your opponent. However, there's a twist: players can influence the outcome by strategically using objects to guide the cow's movements.

Once a player achieves bingo, they must confirm it. However, if they hesitate, the other player can challenge it, potentially causing the nearly victorious player to lose one of their critical numbers.

Players can manipulate the game board by hurling rocks, placing baits, or utilizing a tungbeetle to clear parts of the board.

Overall, Cowbingo is a fast-paced and entertaining game that was a joy to create and remains enjoyable to play.
