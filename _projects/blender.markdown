## Introduction
3D Modelling is one of many skills I picked up and played around with. I have enough skill to produce useful cartoony assets!

Below are a couple examples to showcase what I have created and hopefully paint a clear picture of what you can expect from me. 

## Animation


I created these animated figures for a small-scale project.
The project would've been fine with using someone else's models or just different coloured cubes, but I went the extra mile and created these models in my spare time.

{% include webm.html id="blender_snake" src="/docs/media/blender/snake2.webm" %}
{% include webm.html id="blender_snakedown" src="/docs/media/blender/snake_view2.webm" %}

{% include webm.html id="blender_chest" src="/docs/media/blender/chest.webm" %}

Neither one of these models is especially complex, however, I was pleased with how the animation turned out.

The green larva and the chest are 3D representations from an old NES game called Adventures of Lolo.

## 2D to 3D 

This project is also a rendition of a game character, more specifically Shantae from the game series with the same name. 
<div id="screenshottext" markdown="1">
{% include webm.html id="blender_shantae" src="/docs/media/blender/shantae.webm" %}

<div id="screenshottext_sub" markdown="1">
My rendition does not take inspiration from a single game but rather mixes elements from the various styles Shantae has been portrayed in.

</div>
</div>


## Realism 
It might be a stretch to call the models under this category realistic, but it was my intention to create something less cartoony and more life-like. Can you recognize the person?

Another example of my more realistic works is this model I created based on my somewhat chunky Shiba.
